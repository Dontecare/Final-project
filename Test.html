                      Through this project I focused on studying the relationship between cool and warm colors. Through my study, I was able to form a deeper undestanding of the relationship between the two temperatures whe it comes to effects and lighting.

                    <p>
                      In the front room, lit heavily with moonlight, attempting to use warm colors here raised the questions like: What is emitting the warm light? Are the flames enough to justify warming the entire gazebo area? And does warmth match the mood I am attempting to convey? When analyzing thoughts like these, it became clear that though warmth can be used to stylize an area like this, it just would not fit the theme of realism I was attemting. The cool blue moon overshadows the warm light emitted from the flames.

                    <p>
                    From this realization, I followed that theme within this scene, with each room i noticed less and less natural moonlight was available. While in the front it was very open, in the second room were smaller windows that instead let in some rays of light that would bounce around to light the area. This part would naturally be warmer due to the lack direct natural light. The final room became the warmest of the three. It contained no windows or natural light and depended on only the luminance of the flames to allow visability. This created the opposite of the first room where the moon was prominant.
